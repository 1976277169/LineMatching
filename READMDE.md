This package includes the source codes for  "Novel Coplanar Line-points Invariants for Robust Line Matching Across Views". 

To run the program, please:

1.Run 'TestLMDll' with Microsoft Visual Studio to get lines detected by LSD and points matched by SIFT.
  
  The project of TestLMDll comes from:
  Fan, B., Wu, F., Hu, Z.: Line matching leveraged by point correspondences. In: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2010 IEEE Conference on,
  IEEE (2010) 390¨C397


2.Put the images into directory 'img' , and put the files of matched points and detected lines into directory 'pts&lines'.
 
3.Run linematch (linematch.m) in MATLAB.

Some of the paths need to be changed.
